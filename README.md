# MealzApp Project

## Overview

The **MealzApp** project is a sample application designed to showcase essential Android development skills using modern technologies and architectural patterns. This project leverages **MVVM architecture**, **Kotlin Coroutines** for asynchronous processing, and **Jetpack Compose** for creating a dynamic and user-friendly UI. The application integrates **Retrofit** for efficient data fetching from an external API, following best practices for a modular, testable, and maintainable codebase.

## Technologies and Architectural Patterns

### MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

The **MVVM** pattern is implemented to separate the UI from business logic and data, enhancing code maintainability and modularity.

- **View**: The main UI is displayed in `MealsCategoriesScreen`, which shows meal categories in a scrollable list.
- **ViewModel**: The `MealsCategoriesViewModel` class contains the core logic for fetching and processing data, serving as a bridge between the UI and the model.
- **Model**: Data models like `MealResponse` represent the structure of the data fetched from the API, allowing for seamless data integration in the UI.

### Use Cases

While a formal use-case pattern is not applied here, the `MealsCategoriesViewModel` handles critical data-fetching tasks, maintaining a clean separation of responsibilities to ensure code simplicity and testability.

### Coroutines for Asynchronous Data Fetching

Kotlin Coroutines are used for asynchronous data fetching, ensuring smooth and responsive interactions within the UI. The `viewModelScope` in `MealsCategoriesViewModel` provides a lifecycle-aware coroutine scope that terminates automatically when the ViewModel is cleared.

```kotlin
viewModelScope.launch {
    val meals = getMeals()
    mealState.value = meals
}
